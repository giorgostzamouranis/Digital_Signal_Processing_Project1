# Digital Signal Processing-Python Project 1

The first section of the project focuses on generating and analyzing telephone touch tones using Fourier analysis in Python. Specifically, we generate these tones using a formula derived from the standard frequencies employed in modern phone systems. Following this, we perform Fourier analysis and process a sequence of tones we have synthesized.

The second section is dedicated to applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on provided music or voice signals, with a visual representation of their characteristics.

Lastly, the project addresses biosignal analysis, concentrating on whale sound signals. The analysis aims to determine which sounds may pose a threat or cause harm to endangered species.

This project was developed for the "Digital Signal Processing" course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA. The objective of this work is not to present it as original research but rather as my approach to the assigned tasks. Please refer to the project prompt (in Greek) for detailed information on the three tasks.
